trying different mediums out, other than
the traditional colora and paints!
it always fascinaates me how green symbolises freshness along with 
dark or horrifying nature of things
this qas just an attempt to use both 
of the properties in one artwork
the freshness of a teddy with a slight
sewsoning of horror
hope you like it, artwork in the repository
